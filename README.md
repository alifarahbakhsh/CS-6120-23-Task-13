# CS-6120-23-Task-13
A very simple synthesizer using Z3. I have added exponentiation via the operator `^` to the simple grammer introduced in the class.
Most of the code comes from the `ex2.py` program from the `sampsyo/minisynth` repository. The solver allows us to find the coefficients
in the expanded version of a polynomial like `(x-1) ^ 2`. The holes can only be in the coefficients.
